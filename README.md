# GasScraper
The current gas scraer is in development. In order to run the scraper first run oca_download.py and change the base directory to the location that you want to store the oca pdfs. Then update the path in gas_scraper.py to the current pdf you would like to scrape and run it. Inorder to run the scrpaer you must either run pip install pyPDF2 or have it previously installed.
